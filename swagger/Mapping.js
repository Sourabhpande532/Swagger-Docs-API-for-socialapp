     ♦️How you want to str you'r documetation weather you want to keep in a Separate file or write on the go. it just for your prefference.

     ♦️ don't use for knowledge prefference you know weather you writing code on the go or in separate file. people usually preffer write api on above or routes on the go like put comment /* @openApi description. open link you'll see getting started see e.g 
     in case you don't want to use use above npm link package. but we'wont be using due to use "less package" put it into separate file "more hardwork"😗🫡 for put it into separate file use 2nd link. & install it. after comple borrow some line.
✅🔗♦️ app.use is a middleware, do npm start you'll get error cannot     find module './swaagger.json' the region why i am doing this i want to bring you'r attention something more on documentation explore 2nd link.     
✅🔗♦️ Do you really want to use json in this case??
No.mejority of the time basically in a big corporate you'r gonna see that don't preffer json they rather like to use YAML.
     ♦️ YAML has similar syntax to json but little bit more cleaner if you scroll little bit down 2nd link you will get loader swagger from YAML. go and install to get rid of error.
✅🔗 Although we have nodemon install as we'r making changes in yaml file. it's not monitoring that what's the point of having node js. notice here in terminal it is monitoring js,mjs,json.want to monitor my all package. keep a track of another expression that is yaml. create file nodemon.json. insert one {..}  keep on eye and monitoring the stuff.
